I'm currently working on two proyects related to my new passions: robotics and AI. 

-**Coordinated Navigation in Multiagent Systems**: focuses on the modeling and control of multi-agent dynamical systems, with a particular emphasis on safe navigation, obstacle avoidance, and distributed control. Designing and implementing coordination algorithms inspired by Lyapunov-based methods, predictive control, and potential field techniques, while rigorously analyzing their stability, convergence, and robustness.

-**Neural Networks as Physical Systems**:combines concepts from statistical physics, optimization, and machine learning. I study energy-based neural networks such as Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines.
